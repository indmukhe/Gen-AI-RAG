      "In summary, the UPKJ Bumiputera Status requirement is a set of conditions that companies/firms/cooperatives/corporations must comply with to be recognized as Bumiputera status holders. The requirements include share ownership, board of directors, management members, employees, and financial management. Additionally, applicants must pass a bumiputera status interview/premises visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Can we change our Bumiputera interview Date?\n",
      "G: Yes, the interview date can be rescheduled, but only once before the original interview date and within two weeks from the original confirmed date. To reschedule the interview date, the applicant must make a new date change request through the OLAM system. Failure to attend an interview will result in the Bumiputera status application being considered failed. If the applicant fails the Bumiputera status interview/premises visit, they can reapply after a period of six (6) months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: If yes how do we change our Bumiputera Interview date?\n",
      "G: To change the Bumiputera Interview date, you can do so through the OLAM system. Firstly, you will need to confirm the interview date that has been set. Then, you can reschedule the interview date after confirmation, but only once before the period of three (3) days from the original interview date. New date change requests can be made through the OLAM system.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, if the confirmed interview date is 23.03.2022, you can reschedule the interview date after confirmation on or before 20.03.2022. The new selected date would be 26.03.2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that failure to attend an interview will result in a Bumiputera status application being failed. If you fail the Bumiputera status interview/premises visit, you can reapply only after a period of six (6) months. This is to ensure that the applicant, as the owner/director of the company, gives full commitment and provides themselves with the necessary experience and knowledge, especially in the management and operation of the company, before applying for Bumiputera status in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: I have fail my bumiputera status and the system does not allow me to apply again?\n",
      "G: I do not know.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I can provide some general information related to the query. If the applicant has failed the Bumiputera status interview, they can reapply for the status after a period of six (6) months. This is to ensure that the applicant, as the owner/director of the company, has enough time to gain the necessary experience and knowledge in managing and operating the company before applying for the Bumiputera status again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, it is possible that the system does not allow the applicant to apply again immediately after failing the interview. The applicant may need to wait for the specified period before reapplying.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, I do not know the exact reason why the system does not allow the applicant to apply again. It could be due to various reasons such as system maintenance, technical issues, or updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, I suggest contacting the relevant authorities or the system's customer support for more information and assistance regarding the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Do I need to apply for bumiputera status if I allready have bumi status for mechanical category?\n",
      "G: No, you do not need to apply for Bumiputera status if you already have Bumi status for the mechanical category. According to the information provided, if a company/firm/cooperative/corporation has Bumiputera Status under the field of work/mechanical/electrical, Bumiputera Status interview for new applications in the field of supply and service is not required. However, if you are applying for registration under a different field, such as supply and service, you will need to apply for Bumiputera status for that specific field.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: I wish to apply bumi putera status for my consultancy firm, can you help?\n",
      "G: Yes, I can help you with that. To apply for Bumiputera status for your consultancy firm, you will need to meet the conditions set by UPKJ, which include:\n",

      "You will also need to pass a Bumiputera status interview and/or premises visit. If you fail the interview or premises visit, you can reapply after a period of six (6) months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, you will need to provide the following documents:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The latest SSM Corporate Info.\n",
      "2. Bank statement or financial signature confirmation letter/company check that has been certified by the Bank.\n",

      "\n",
      "Please note that the Bumiputera status re-interview is required if there is a major shareholder/equity change in the company/firm/cooperative/corporation.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Q: What are the document needed if I wish to apply for bumi putera status?\n",
      "G: The documents needed to apply for Bumiputera Status are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The latest SSM Corporate Info*\n",
      "2. Bank statement or financial signature confirmation letter/company check that has been certified by the Bank (with the following information):*\n",

      "Note: *Mandatory, **Mandatory if you contribute to the EPF.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: How can I renew my company bumiputera status?\n",
      "G: To renew your company's bumiputera status, you need to submit a renewal application to UPKJ. The application must include the latest SSM corporate information, bank statements, EPF (if applicable), birth certificates of owner/shareholder/director, and images of the office building and in-office signatory. The application will be processed, and if approved, the bumiputera status will be renewed. If not approved, you can reapply after six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: What is Bumiputera Sarawak?\n",
      "G: Bumiputera Sarawak refers to a status granted to companies/firms/cooperatives/corporations that are owned and controlled by ethnic Malays, indigenous people of Sarawak, and meet certain conditions set by the Sarawak government. The status is granted through an application process and is subject to renewal. It is not a right granted by birth, but a privilege given to those who meet the conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q: Can my company apply for bumiputera status if the there’s 3 shareholder. The majority shareholder is bumi and the remaining is non bumi. \n",
      "G: I do not know.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I can provide some general information related to the query. The query asks if a company can apply for bumiputera status if there are 3 shareholders, with the majority shareholder being Bumi and the remaining non-Bumi.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the context information provided, a company can apply for bumiputera status if the majority or at least 51% of the shares/equity is held by Bumiputera Sarawak, and the majority or at least 51% of the members of the board of directors are consisting of Bumiputera Sarawak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems that the company may be eligible to apply for bumiputera status if the majority shareholder is Bumi and the remaining shareholders are non-Bumi, as long as the company meets the other requirements for bumiputera status.\n",
